# django-docker

*A simple django project example using docker*

### Requirements
- [docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

### Starting
- Clone this repository
- Create the docker container executing the comand in project home dir:
  ```docker-compose up -d```
 
*The container has a link to your local project directory, so, if you alter anyone thing in your code, this reflect in the code of the container that is executing*

Now, you can access your project in browser by: localhost:8000

have fun :)
